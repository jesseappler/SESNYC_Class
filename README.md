# Jesse's SESYNC Training 

This is Jesse's SESYNC Training and her goals are:

- Figure out how to have one way (pull, repull, etc.) communication with git hub, that's then pushed to other places (internal or github)

- Figure out how to make pretty visualizations of things over time and space

- Ponder collaborative processes for the division and how to implement them
